.. warning:: Beware: rapidly changing documentation!

   This is the bleeding-edge documentation for Annotator which will be changing
   rapidly as we home in on Annotator v2.0. Information here may be inaccurate,
   prone to change, and otherwise unreliable. You may well want to consult `the
   stable documentation`_ instead.

Welcome to the documentation for Annotator, an open-source JavaScript library
for building annotation systems on the web. At its simplest, Annotator is an
application that allows users to make textual annotations on any web page. You
can deploy it using just a few lines of integration code.

Annotator is also a library of composable tools for annotation applications.
It includes tools for capturing and manipulating DOM selections, tools for
storage and persistence of annotations, and a variety of user interface
components. You can use a few or many of these components together to build your
own custom annotation-based application.

You can start learning about how to install and deploy Annotator below:
